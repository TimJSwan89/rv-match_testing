These single file projects will likely be added as a main project when https://github.com/runtimeverification/rv-match_testing/issues/35 is resolved so that each one's build results will be independently reported.

testing.c is the development file here.
It's default state should be:
// testing.c
// https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C-Extensions.html
int main() { return 0; }

progresstracker.txt should be kept up to date for the time being.

develop with testing.c and use try.sh to test it
