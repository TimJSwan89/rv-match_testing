Before someone should take over primary control of this project, they:
1. would need to be working for the company.
2. have access to issue reporting for rv_match.
3. are aware of what Chris is working on so you have an idea of what type of bug report stream he needs.
4. understand which projects are a priority to get compiled and tested with rv-match.
This may only take 1-2 months.
